                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am a Mechanical Engineer by training with a deep passion for the logic of software. My journey began in the workshop, designing gears and analyzing stress points, but I quickly realized that the future of hardware lies in its ability to think. Today, I sit at the intersection of physical engineering and artificial intelligence, building systems that interact with the real world in intelligent ways.

                    <p>
                        My educational background includes a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering, where I specialized in Mechatronics. During my studies, I taught myself Python and C++, eventually moving into full-stack development and machine learning. I believe that understanding the "nuts and bolts" gives me a unique advantage in writing code for robotics, automation, and IoT devices. I don't just write algorithms; I understand the machines they control.

                        When I'm not coding or CAD modeling, you can find me tinkering with 3D printers, hiking to clear my head, or experimenting with home automation projects. I am always looking for the next problem to solve, driven by the belief that minimalist design and robust engineering can create technology that feels almost like magic.
